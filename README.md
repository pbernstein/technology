# What college does for you and why it's a good thing

The benefits vs the debt. At some point, writing software is about being able to communicate with a team. That means a lot of writing, reading, speaking, and sound fundamental computer science. 

# What about For Profit Universities?

Google search their name with the word "Fraud", if you see a lot of stuff come back, avoid them.  Watch out for big sales pitches. In almost all cases, a community college is the better option.
